#7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
The top 10 most rated apps in terms generate do not necessary generate the best
user_rating (#1 Facebook has a 3.5/5 user rating), but overall those top 10 tend to
have to have very positive (>4/5) ratings.

Moreover, all of them are Free apps, which helps to generate massive rating engagement

#8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
All Top 10 Best rated Apps obviously have a 5/5 rating, byt tend to generate way less
rating counts in total.
They Most of them are paying apps, with a price some may consider high price.
Therefore they aim at a more precise, if not "nice", audience, who is ready to pay
the price for the App and may be more easily satisfied by the App because they paid
to answser a specific need they had.

#9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
As stated above, most rated Apps tend to be Free apps and generate massive engagement, but not always top ratings.
Whereas Users paying for Apps, and here among the Top 10 Best rated app, Half of the paid Apps are Games, to which satisfied players may more easily give positive ratings if they fulfill their eager videogame needs ! (Plants Vs. Zombies is obviously quite a funny game)

The price of an App seems to be an important barrier between massive usage (of course).
Those paying for an App may have higher expectation for an App, since they just gave away 10â‚¬ or so, but if the App answsers their needs, the end-user might more easily positively engage to it.
